# challenge 2
Second challenge. No styling just the framework tools

I couldn't take the images, so I improvised with some Google-found images.
Couldn't edit the orange colour on "our clients". Blue is the new orange.
If by no styling means that no CSS must me edited/input, I guess color="orange" would do the job in the HTMl
